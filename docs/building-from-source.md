# Building From the Latest Source

If you'll be contributing to the library, or need a version newer than what has
been released, Anidero from ZeoFlow can also be built from source.
To do so:

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeoflow/anidero.git
```

Then, build the library's AARs using Gradle
